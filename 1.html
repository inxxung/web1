<p><h3>Abstract</h3></p>
This work explores the effects of dietary <strong>Radix Rehmanniae Preparata polysaccharide <u>(RRPP)</u></strong> supplementation on the growth performance, nonspecific immune responses, immune- and growth-related gene expression and disease resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila in Luciobarbus capito. <br>Diets containing five concentrations of 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.4% RRPP were fed to fish for 60d
The results indicated that the growth performance significantly increased in the 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.4% RRPP groups compared with that in the control. The activities of serum lysozyme (LAZ), acid phosphatase (ACP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and total protein (TP) were significantly increased in the appropriate RRPP supplemented groups. With respect to immune- and growth-related genes, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-Î³, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-2, up-regulation were observed in the three organs (kidney, spleen, gut) of the fish fed with RRPP, compared with the control. In contrast, the mRNA expression of IL-10 and transforming-growth factor (TGF)-beta were downregulated. After challenge with A. hydrophila, the final survival rate was significantly higher in fish fed the RRPP supplement than that in the control group. In conclusion, RRPP enhanced the growth performance, immune response and disease resistance of Luciobarbus capito, with the greatest effects at 0.2% RRPP.

<p><h3>1. Introduction</h3>
Luciobarbus capito belongs to the family cyprinidae, barbinae and barbus genus, and the species is native to the Aral Sea of Uzbekistan [1]. In 2003, Luciobarbus capito was first introduced by China and subsequently promoted in many cities. As a large economic fish, Luciobarbus capito has the characteristics of wide feeding, rapid growth, tender meat and saline-alkali resistance, and it is suitable for saline-alkali water or freshwater aquaculture in China [2]. The expansion in the size of Luciobarbus capito farming has led to a high susceptibility of the fish to various disease pathogen. Traditional control methods rely mainly on antibiotics and chemotherapeutics, which cause potential harm to the quality and safety of water products [3]. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to find safe additives to replace antibiotic drugs. The application of Chinese herbal medicine in aquaculture is in line with the criteria for disease prevention in development of pollution-free aquatic products and production of green aquatic products.
Radix Rehmanniae Preparata (RRP) is processed from Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, a comprehensive traditional Chinese herbal medicine that belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae [4]. Pharmacological studies showed that RRP possesses wide actions of nourishing yin, supplementing blood, boosting essence, and filling bone marrow. Different compounds such as polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, glycosides, iridoid glycosides, flavonoid, phenol glycoside ionone, furfurals, and microelements have been isolated from RRP [5,6]. Polysaccharides are important chemical components of RRP, and their bioactivities have been studied, including the effects of anti-anxiety [7], anti-fatigue [8], anti-diabetes [9], alleviation of intestinal mucositis [10], antitumour [11] and immune enhancement <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0263436817302019?token=BC7DDE4C087ECD2C70D1E54C4B5FE83792A53660A9CA26006CC7152556B853005206807E649E177BACE56BBC81369259"
