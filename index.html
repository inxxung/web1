<p><h3>Abstract</h3></p>
This work explores the effects of dietary <strong>Radix Rehmanniae Preparata polysaccharide <u>(RRPP)</u></strong> supplementation on the growth performance, nonspecific immune responses, immune- and growth-related gene expression and disease resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila in Luciobarbus capito. <br>Diets containing five concentrations of 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.4% RRPP were fed to fish for 60d
The results indicated that the growth performance significantly increased in the 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.4% RRPP groups compared with that in the control. The activities of serum lysozyme (LAZ), acid phosphatase (ACP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and total protein (TP) were significantly increased in the appropriate RRPP supplemented groups. With respect to immune- and growth-related genes, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-Î³, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-2, up-regulation were observed in the three organs (kidney, spleen, gut) of the fish fed with RRPP, compared with the control. In contrast, the mRNA expression of IL-10 and transforming-growth factor (TGF)-beta were downregulated. After challenge with A. hydrophila, the final survival rate was significantly higher in fish fed the RRPP supplement than that in the control group. In conclusion, RRPP enhanced the growth performance, immune response and disease resistance of Luciobarbus capito, with the greatest effects at 0.2% RRPP.
