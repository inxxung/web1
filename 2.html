<p><h2><strong>Effects of dietary Radix Rehmanniae Preparata polysaccharides on
the growth performance,<br>immune response and disease resistance of Luciobarbus
capito</strong></h2></P>

<h3>2. Materials and methods</h3>
2.1. Fish and RRPP
In this study, Luciobarbus capito were obtained from Suqian Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China. The fish were acclimatized to laboratory conditions (pH: 6.5–7.5, water temperature: 25 ± 1 °C, dissolved oxygen: 5.5–6.5 mg/L, and nitrites: 0.01–0.02 mg/L) for two weeks prior to the experiment. All fish were fed with a commercial diet three times per day.
RRPP is a commercial product purchased from Yangling Ciyuan biotech Co., Ltd (Xi-an City, China). The polysaccharide content reached 95.18%, and the material was stored at −20 °C.
</p>
2.2. Experimental diets
The commercially formulated diet was selected as the basal diet (control, Con). The diets contained approximately 37.9% crude protein, 8.6% lipid and 13.6% ash. The basal diets were supplemented with different RRPP levels (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.4%). All ingredients were mixed thoroughly into a mixture and pelletized with a flat die pellet mill. The pellets were subsequently air-dried and stored in plastic bags at −20 °C. The formulation and composition of all diets are shown in Table 1.
